kinectcharacter
===============

Character collage with kinect for ICA Teens workshop.

You can get ofxOpenNI here https://github.com/gameoverhack/ofxOpenNI/.


To add another character, create a folder inside bin that includes parts.xml and a corresponding images folder.

L and R keys to switch characters.

There's a useHardware bool in testApp.cpp that needs to be set to true when using Kinect.
